2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
PDRC-153#1 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net U_CTRL/enable_cnt_reg_i_1_n_0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin U_CTRL/enable_cnt_reg_i_1/O, cell U_CTRL/enable_cnt_reg_i_1. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#2 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net U_CTRL/led_OBUF[2] is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin U_CTRL/led_OBUF[2]_inst_i_1/O, cell U_CTRL/led_OBUF[2]_inst_i_1. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#3 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net U_CTRL/show_result_reg_i_2_n_0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin U_CTRL/show_result_reg_i_2/O, cell U_CTRL/show_result_reg_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>
